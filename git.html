    <h4>What are the benefits of version control?</h4>

          I like the video game analogy, so I think it's like playing a group video game, where you can actually save the team member from falling into an abyss or from being eaten by a monster and they can save you and give you healing potions by either going back in time on your commits or working on the code at the same time and finding a better solution. The reason why it works is because GitGub gives a platform that prevents you from overwritting each others' code, before you start you pull the changes that have been made or you merge your changes together, that way everyone is aware of what other team members are doing when it matters. So even if someone is working on a secret weapon to destroy a dragon, by the time they want to add it to the game, the git octocat will say "Hey! This version of the weapon has already been added," maybe even at the same time in a tiny different version, and will ask "Do you wish to implement your own anyway? Or merge the changes?" Or, the git octocat will say "Hey your weapon killed everyone because it was terrible, let's go back one commit and try again!"

        </li>

          It also keeps track of your changes in a file, normally code. The thing is that there are several ways to do the same thing using code, so it makes it easy to explore different algorithms. Then, if you mess up, you don't have to start from scratch, you just reset.

        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h4>
    <p>
      By giving you commits a number and giving you tools like branches ... I will elaborate on this
    </p>
    <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>

          It's awesome
