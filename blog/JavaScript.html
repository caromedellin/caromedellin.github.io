    <h3>Objects in JS</h3>
    <p>Objects are arbitrary collections of properties, we can add and remove things as we see fit. They are created with curly brace notation and spaces are not significant inside them. Properties with unvalid names you need to put in between quotes.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      var averageDay = {
  breakfast: false,
  events: ["Take naps", "Drink wine", "Exercise", “click computer",
           "Stalk strangers on Instagram "]
};
    </pre>

    <p>It’s similar to a Hash in ruby. Something very confusing about objects is that they have 2 meanings in JavaScript. At the start of a statement, they start a block of statements and in any other position it’s just to describe an object. But thanks god this is not typical in programs so they are normally just used to describe objects or so my current book describes.
  Although I have seen some videos about using the ruby hashes to refactor methods and that completely blew my mind! I guess that is similar to this, but I will not get in depth with those options.
  If we try to access a property that doesn’t exit the program will spit us out an undefined value. And so we’ll now that spot is available to be defined so it’s not that bad. We can assign values inside it using the = operator just like to in ruby.
 I enjoy the eloquent JavaScript description of an object resembling an octopus, and for that when we use the delete operator we’d be cutting of a tentacle from thagt object.</p>
 <p>The we have binary operator to check for things inside the object</p>
 <ul>
   <li>delete</li>
   <li>in</li>
   <li>typeof</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Mutability:</h4>
  <p>Objects can be modified, unlike values such as string, numbers and Booleans. Such values are immutable. </p>
  <h4>As Maps:</h4>
  <p>They also act as a way to relate to values</p>
  
  <p>Objects in JavaScript can be compared to objects in real life, they are standalone entities each one has their own properties and type. So you could compare them to real life things, such as a dog. Every dog has a color, a type a name that defines them. 
You can access their properties with property name
dog.hairColor
Like all JavaScript variables, they are case snetitive. You can define a property by giving it a value, for instance:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      var myDog = new Object ( );
      myDog.name = “Dosha”;
      myDog.hairColor = “Black and White”;
      myDog.age = 3;
      //You can also access these properties with the bracket notation. Objects are like the Ruby Hashes, associative arrays, so in that sense they can be multidimensional!
      myDog[“name”] = “Dosha”;
      myDog[“hairColor”] = “Black and White”];
      myDog[“age”] = 3;
      (my dog is actually 5 but likes to lie about her age)
    </pre>
    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <p>A method is a function associated with an object. We define them in the same way we would define a property. The difference is that we write a function right after the equal signs instead of string or a number; In the following example I will illustrate woman change their age every year. This year I will be 25, but next year I’m not sure</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
        var me= new Object();
        me.name = "Carolina";
        me.age = 28;
        // and I make my set age method that will make me younger just like in the code academy example.
        me.setAge = function (newAge){
          me.age = newAge;
        };
        // here is where the magic happens, if you don’t call the method, the method will just rest on top of your program defined but nothing is changed nor returned.
        me.setAge(25);
        </pre>
    <p>Methods are important to change property values and also to make calculations based on the object’s properties. What happens if that you need to organized it, and it becomes easy to use, and maintain. If you design your code in terms of the real world then if becomes easy to understand if becomes independent of the coder.
    </p>  
    <h4>Abstraction</h4> 
    <p>It exposes what’s necessary, it’s to remove complexity
  Don’t show unnecessary things</p> 
    <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
    <p>Hide complexity. In the sense that it complements abstraction
  Abstraction is more for design it’s  to hide things from the user, to declare private methods.</p>
    <h3>So now, what's different?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript Objects:
  They are data structures just like hashes in Ruby
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  var dog = {};
  dog.color = “brown”;
  </pre> 


There’s different ways to write this in JavaScript. That is part of the literal creation of objects but you may also use constructor functions.

The main difference with JavaScript objects its that they can contain functions, that is extremely useful, JavaScript is very flexible with the type of data it allows in to the variables and in to the objects. That can also lead to a lot of mistakes, and makes them even harder to find.

But in this case that would translate in to :
<pre class="prettyprint">
  dog.bark = function(){
    console.log(“rawr!!!”);
  };
</pre>

This means also that in JavaScript there’s no such thing as “pass by reference”. You pass on the object, so you can modify the content of the object.
</p>
  <h4>The Ruby Object:</h4>
  <p>The ruby object is a collection of properties that point to other objects, so their collections point to other objects. You can’t access the instance variables like you do with a simple this.variable in JS. Ruby has from design some encapsulation that protects this variable from being changed left and right. And so only in the context of those. methods you can change them, but in the real variable.

Yes they are both just collections, but the JS one don’t have as much access restriction from design as the Ruby one, actually they get automatically initialized with reader writer I believe, unless you manually define it otherwise. But this it self does not achieve any encapsulation. There is no direct object encapsulation in JS, from what I have read so far.</p>
