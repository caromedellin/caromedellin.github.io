  <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <p>Any word that is not part of the ruby language will create an error.
It's up to us to define a local variable or method to give it meaning.

<p class="code">Var = something--- creates a new varword</p>

<p>They are important because it encapsulates data that can create a single variable and you can rely on that abstraction that allows you to easily reference it. The literal piece of data is the string and the abstraction is the name of the variable. That way we can focus on varwords and adding new semantics.</p>

<p>Variables can point to any value you want, reassigning variables is pretty easy, one confusing things about variables its that when you make a var equal to the first value it doesn't update because it's equal to the reference, its the pass by value vs pass by reference. Variables in ruby are not pass by reference so that no variable ever follows the value of another variable.</p>

<p>Hashes and Arrays are indexed collections, much like a bookshelf, the arrays have numeric indexes and the hashes have actual names that are unique to them. </p>
