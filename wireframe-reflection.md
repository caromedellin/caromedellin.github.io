#On Wireframes

##  □ What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a sketch of your website before any kind of design takes places, just a display of the elements. It's kind of what the website will grow to be. It let's you stablish hierarchy of info, where the most important elements will go.  
##  □ What are the benefits of wireframing?
The most important one is that it saves you time and you can design the hierarchy of the elements in your website, also it's not distracting. It let's you decide what users must know first, where you want to take them and how to lead them to do certain actions.

##  □ Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did it was a fun task made me feel more advanced and it totally made UX relevant. It was super fun to do! I even learned that most people see websites on an F shape pattern, they start form the top-left corner, then go almost all the way to the right, then down and left again. 
##  □ Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I still need to revise it, specially for when it gets scaled down in to mobile
  □ What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I like YouTube channels I like a couple of ones like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptf1xjSlOKs le wagon because some words are easier to understand in spanish when they are translated from french. And I haven't found any channels that I like in spanish I also like podcasts on iTunes, I just listen to some of them on the background and if I have a question I put it on youtube so I can see it being solved. I liked this one for wireframing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDlnMiKBTiI
